/*
There are lot of inbuilt packages that make the code more easy and neat.
you first need to write -> npm init     # do it in the root directory of your project and you node package manager is ready
then write -> npm install chalk validator       # install whatever packages you need for your project
don't forget to import/require them in the start of your code files by writing const chalk = require("chalk")
For example ->
1) Chalk -> With this you can design your console outputs with colors and all
2) Validator -> With this you can check for like, whether the given input is email or not by using isEmail(input)
3) Nodemon -> Its one of the best package xD (you know why right)
